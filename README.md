# DFI (Decentralized Finance)

## Description
This repository contains the code for the DFI (Decentralized Finance) project. The project is a decentralized finance API that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. The API is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to manage the lending and borrowing process.

## features
- Binary options trading
- Bonding curve
- Decentralized exchange
- Lending protocol
- Interest rates and credit discoveries

## Technologies
- Solidity 
- Truffle
- Ganache

## features
1. Main API gateway allows:
   - Users request new loans
   - Users deposit collateral
   - shorters and lenders to interact with the lending protocol
  
2. Binary options market
   - Long and short binary options
   - shorters can bet on the loan getting defaulted
   - lenders can bet on the loan getting repaid
3. bonding curve
    it is a mathematical curve that defines a relationship between the price of a token and the supply of the token. 

4. Interest rate discovery and credit scoring
    - risk is determined by the ratio of longs to shorts
